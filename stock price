Max no of transection is k 
    Approach1 
    using dp
    Approach2
    Using greedy : 
        try to find all possible transection and keep on adding them in list.
        try to merge this list
        
            /   =>    /     
        /            /  
        
        then add these transections in max heap
        and remove top k transections

=>Algorithm

The general idea is to store all consecutively increasing subsequence as the initial solution. 
Then delete or merge transactions until the number of transactions less than or equal to k.
